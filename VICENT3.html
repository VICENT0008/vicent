    <p class="pnot">Have you ever wondered how Mercedes-Benz names their vehicles, such as the Mercedes-Benz CLA, Mercedes-Benz GLA, Mercedes-Benz GLE, and more? There are also many models that have had their names changed over the years, such as the Mercedes-Benz ML becoming the Mercedes-Benz GLE, or the Mercedes-Benz GL becoming the Mercedes-Benz GLS. For those that are new to the Mercedes-Benz brand, or for those that are used to the older model names, it can be a little confusing. However, Mercedes-Benz names their vehicles for a reason, and try to make it as easy as possible for people to distinguish models. Here is a run-down of how Mercedes-Benz names their vehicles.</p>
   <p class="pnot">Mercedes-Benz Core Models
    Mercedes-Benz has five core models that are always a part of the naming nomenclature. These five core models are A, B, C, E, and S. Mercedes-Benz uses these core models internationally, therefore some letters do not apply to the United States market. Many of these core models apply to the United States market, such as C being the C-Class sedan, C-Class Coupe, and C-Class Cabriolet.</p>

    <img src="./car01.png"class="srrc">
    <p class="pnot">The extra letters that are added on to core model letters on many models, such as the CLA and GLC also have meanings. Mercedes-Benz models such as the Mercedes-Benz CLS and Mercedes-Benz CLA have the letters CL added on. The CL means that the vehicle is a 4-door coupe, and therefore only applies to the four-door coupes of the Mercedes-Benz lineup.</p>

    <img src="./car6.jpg"class="srrc">
    <p class="pnot">Also, models such as the Mercedes-Benz SL and Mercedes-Benz SLC have the letters SL in their naming, to distinguish them as a Roadster vehicle. These roadster vehicles are often two-seater vehicles that feature a hardtop convertible roof. The previous Mercedes-Benz SLK Roadster is now renamed the Mercedes-Benz SLC.</p>
    <img src="./car7.png"class="src">
    <b><p>Last but not least, our many models that feature the letters GL. These vehicles include the Mercedes-Benz GLS, Mercedes-Benz GLE, Mercedes-Benz GLC, and Mercedes-Benz GLA. The GL prefix is meant to be a nod to the famous signature Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV, which is the flagship SUV of the Mercedes-Benz SUV lineup. Therefore, any Mercedes-Benz vehicle with the letters GL will be considered an SUV. Many of the Mercedes-Benz SUVs that many people know and love have been affected by the new naming standards of Mercedes-Benz and have been renamed. These models include the Mercedes-Benz ML, Mercedes-Benz GL, and Mercedes-Benz GLK. The Mercedes-Benz ML is now the Mercedes-Benz GLE, the Mercedes-Benz GL is renamed the Mercedes-Benz GLS, and the Mercedes-Benz GLK is now the Mercedes-Benz GLC.
        As a review, here is a summary of the meanings of Mercedes-Benz models as a review.
        Five Core Models – A, B, C, E, and S
        GL Prefix – SUV models, such as the Mercedes-Benz GLS, Mercedes-Benz GLE, Mercedes-Benz GLC, and Mercedes-Benz GLA
        CL Prefix – 4-door-coupes, such as the Mercedes-Benz CLA and Mercedes-Benz CLS
        SL Prefix – Roadsters, such as the Mercedes-Benz SLC and Mercedes-Benz SL.
